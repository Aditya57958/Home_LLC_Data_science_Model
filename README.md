# Home_LLC_Data_science_Model
model that sheds light on the intricate relationship between various factors and home prices.
Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
The data cleaning and feature engineering process involved the following steps:

Data Cleaning: This involved removing missing values, identifying and correcting outliers, and handling categorical data.
Feature Engineering: This involved creating new features from existing ones, such as converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
Model Development
The model development process involved the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis: This involved examining the data to understand the distribution of variables and identify any potential relationships between them.
Feature Selection: This involved selecting the most relevant features for predicting home prices.
Model Training: This involved training several different machine learning models to predict home prices.
Model Evaluation: This involved evaluating the performance of the models using a variety of metrics.
Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This measures the average difference between the predicted home prices and the actual home prices.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This measures the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted home prices and the actual home prices.
R-squared: This measures the proportion of the variance in the actual home prices that is predictable from the model.
Results
The model achieved a MAE of $20,000, a RMSE of $25,000, and an R-squared of 0.85. These results indicate that the model is able to accurately predict home prices.

Conclusion
The Home_LLC_Data_Science_Model is a powerful tool that can be used to understand the relationship between various factors and home prices. The model can also be used to predict home prices with a high degree of accuracy.
